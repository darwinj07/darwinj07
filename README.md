<h1 align="left">Hi, I'm Darwin.</h1>
<h3 align="left"> I'm a software engineer studying CS at Seoul National University.</h3>

- I will join Moloco as an SWE early next year.
  
- I've worked on **Cistern**, a Notion backup service.

- Iâ€™ve worked on [Calendy](https://github.com/snuhcs-course/swpp-2023-project-team-10), a task and schedule management equipped with AI Manager that supports voice/text commands to perform all kinds of operations. Learn more about how I implemented AI Manager [here](https://github.com/snuhcs-course/SNU-swpp-team-10/wiki/Manager-Implementation-Details).
